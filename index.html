        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <center><p>Our journey together has been filled with phone calls and texts!! I hope we meet soon!! Your presence in my life brings happiness.</p>
       
        <p>
        I know this is childish, but I can't stop thinking about you.
        Here's some cheesy lines for you: <br>
        In your eyes, the stars align,
        Your laughter, like music, so divine.

        With every smile, my world brightens too,
        In your presence, my heart finds its true hue.

        Shiva, your essence fills the air,
        In your simplicity, I find a love so rare.</p></center>
